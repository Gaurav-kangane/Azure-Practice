What is an Azure NSG?
    An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for Azure resources. It decides who can talk to what, on which port, and from where.

You can attach an NSG to:
    A subnet
    A network interface (NIC) of a VM



What is an Azure NIC?
    An Azure Network Interface (NIC) is the component that connects a virtual machine to an Azure Virtual Network.
    Every Azure VM must have at least one NIC.
    
    Think of it as the VM’s network card.

What a NIC contains
A NIC can have:
    Private IP address (mandatory)
    
    Public IP address (optional)
    
    Subnet association
    
    NSG attached at NIC level

    IP configuration (ipconfig)


NIC-level NSG (very important)
    You can attach an NSG directly to a NIC.
    Rules applied at NIC level are more specific than subnet rules.

Example:
    Subnet NSG allows SSH (22)
    
    NIC NSG allows only HTTP (80)
    
    👉 You cannot SSH to that VM.
    
    Rule: Subnet NSG + NIC NSG → both must allow.





What is Azure VNet Peering?
    Azure VNet Peering connects two Virtual Networks (VNets) so resources can communicate privately using Azure’s backbone network, not the public internet.  
    Peered VNets behave almost like one large network.

Key rules (very important)
    VNets must not have overlapping IP ranges
    Peering can be within the same region or across regions (Global Peering)
    Traffic is private, high-speed, low latency
