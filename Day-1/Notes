1. Core network concept

AWS

    Uses Amazon VPC
    
    Very explicit separation of public and private networking
    
    Internet access is tightly controlled using gateways and route tables

Azure

    Uses Azure Virtual Network
    
    Feels more integrated and simplified
    
    Internet access is often implicit once rules allow it

👉 Think of AWS as more “build it piece by piece”, Azure as more “plug and configure”.

2. Subnets

AWS

    Subnets are public or private by design
    
    Public subnet = route to Internet Gateway
    
    Private subnet = no internet unless NAT is added

Azure

    No public/private subnet concept
    
    Any subnet can host public or private resources
    
    Internet access depends on NSG + routing

👉 AWS enforces structure. Azure gives flexibility.

3. Internet access

AWS

    Requires Internet Gateway
    
    Outbound internet from private subnet needs NAT Gateway
    
    Nothing works unless routing is correct

Azure

    Internet access is default-enabled
    
    Controlled mainly via NSGs
    
    NAT is usually optional, not mandatory
    
    👉 AWS is strict and explicit. Azure is permissive by default.

4. Security layer (firewall)

AWS

    Security Groups → instance-level (stateful)
    
    Network ACL → subnet-level (stateless)

Azure

    Network Security Group → subnet or NIC level
    
    NSG replaces most use cases of NACL + SG

👉 AWS splits security into two layers. Azure keeps it simpler with NSG.

5. Routing

AWS

    Route tables are mandatory and explicit
    
    Every subnet must be associated with a route table
    
    You always know where traffic goes

Azure

    System routes exist by default
    
    User Defined Routes are optional
    
    Easier but sometimes less obvious

6. Load balancers

AWS

    Application Load Balancer
    
    Network Load Balancer
    
    Classic Load Balancer (legacy)

Azure

    Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4)
    
    Application Gateway (Layer 7 + WAF)
    
    👉 AWS has more variants. Azure combines features.

7. Hybrid connectivity (On-prem to cloud)

AWS

    AWS Direct Connect
    
    Site-to-Site VPN

Azure

    Azure ExpressRoute
    
    VPN Gateway
    
    Both are solid. Azure often feels easier with Microsoft enterprise setups.
