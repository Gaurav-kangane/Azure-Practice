What is a DNS Zone in Azure  (It is like Route53 in AWS)
    A DNS zone is a container that holds DNS records for a domain. In Azure, DNS zones are managed using Microsoft Azure DNS, 
    which lets you host and manage domain name resolution without running your own DNS servers.

Example:
    If your domain is example.com, the DNS zone is example.com, and it contains records like A, CNAME, MX, etc.


Common DNS Record Types
You’ll typically manage these inside a DNS zone:
    A – Maps name to IPv4 address   
    AAAA – Maps name to IPv6 address
    CNAME – Alias to another DNS name
    MX – Mail server records
    TXT – Verification, SPF, DKIM
    NS – Name servers (auto-created)
    SOA – Zone metadata (auto-created)

Azure Application Gateway is a Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancer used to manage and secure web traffic. It works at the application level, so it understands URLs, headers, cookies, and SSL.
What it’s used for
    Hosting web applications and APIs
    Smart routing based on URL paths or hostnames
    SSL termination and certificate management
    Protecting apps using Web Application Firewall (WAF)



1. Layer 7 Load Balancing
Routes traffic based on:
    URL path (/app1, /api)
    Host name (app.example.com)
    HTTP headers
    This is more advanced than basic load balancing.
