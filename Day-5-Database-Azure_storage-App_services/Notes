What is an Azure Storage Account?
    An Azure Storage Account is a container for data services provided by Microsoft Azure.

One storage account can hold:
    Blobs (objects)
    Files (shared file system)
    Queues (messages)
    Tables (NoSQL key-value


1. Blob Storage
    For unstructured data
    Images, videos, logs, backups
    Containers → blobs
    Hot / Cool / Archive tiers

Common use
    App uploads
    Backup storage
    Static website hosting


2. File Storage
    For file shares
    SMB / NFS access
    Can be mounted on VMs
    Acts like a shared drive

Common use
    Lift-and-shift apps
    Shared config files
    Legacy apps

What is Azure App Service?
    Azure App Service is a fully managed PaaS service from Microsoft Azure to host web applications and APIs.

You deploy your code.
Azure handles:
    Servers
    OS patching
    Scaling
    Availability
    Security basics
    No VM management needed.


What can you host on App Service?
You can host:
    Web apps
    
    REST APIs
    
    Backend services
    
    Mobile app backends

Supported runtimes
    .NET
    
    Java
    
    Node.js
    
    Python
    
    PHP
    
    Ruby
    
    Custom containers (Docker)


Why Azure App Service is used
1. No server management
    You don’t:
    Create VMs
    Patch OS
    Configure load balancers
    Azure handles all of that. You focus only on code.

2. Faster development and deployment
    You can:
    Deploy in minutes
    Push code directly from GitHub
    Roll back easily using deployment slots
    This speeds up development and releases.

3. Easy scaling
    When traffic increases:
    Scale up (more CPU/RAM)
    Scale out (more instances)
    Auto-scale based on demand
    No manual infra changes needed.

4. Built-in high availability
    Apps run on multiple instances
    Load balanced automatically
    Failures are handled by Azure
    You don’t design HA yourself.
